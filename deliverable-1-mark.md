## Feedback
Product
- Target users is quite brief. Is there differentiation between the hosts and guests?
- Verification is clearly important and well discussed, but how is verification achieved? Is there a person checking these IDs and GIFs? Is it AI? Are the IDs available for everyone else on the app?
- All sections could use more detail which comes from deep investigation into the problem and users.

Plan
- Understandability of Roles and Responsibilities suffers due to the formatting of this section. Consider a table or even just bullet points.
- Roles themselves are not described. 
- Which task board? Physical? Trello?
- Functionality in what sense? All things have some functionality, how does the team know which functionality is better (ie, in the right direction)?

Overall Quality
 - Some spelling (gif/git pictures). 
- Instructions left in. 
- Markdown formatting issues.
- A few sections could benefit from formatting in order to better present your work.
