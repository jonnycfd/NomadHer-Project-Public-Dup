Product
- I was able to install the APK on my phone from Drive, but after clicking on the Facebook sign-in button, the app would flash but not do anything else. I know the app works as I saw a demo in Monday's tutorial. I have tried removing the app and re-installing from both the GitHub APK and Drive, yet now I am unable to install at all.
- Team must contact the TAs and setup a time to demo the application for an accurate grade.

README.md
- Just FYI, your code does not need to be in the `deliverable` folder. The D2 instructions were not completely clear. Only thing that *needs* to be in `deliverables` are the markdowns; rest of the structure is up to you. This is great as is; just thought it might help your organization. 
- Formatting on Description requires lots of sideways scrolling as there is no line wrap. I'd recommend checking formatting after pushing to GitHub.
- Features walks the line between listing features and instructions/app flows.
- Consider putting the Screen Shots inline rather than having user have to browse to a different page.
- Instructions look ok but I am unable to test the app myself. 

plan.md
- Improvements in formatting vs. D1 helps with document quality. Still some of the instructions left in.
  - GitHub steps are good, but why use bullet points when there are numbered lists in Markdown?
- Deployment and Github Workflow is well broken down which makes for easy reading for a new member.
  - While the deployment may be the same as A1, these documents are aimed at readers that are not knowledgeable about the course. Consider a technical person working at your partner organization. 
- Product Artifacts should probably include things like the Android app, the backend server, etc as well.

review.md
- If the front and back ends are in completely different folders, would this not prevent overlap? Not sure how separate branches would be beneficial here as the documents does not comment much.
- Appears to be conflict between claiming that the 3/4 front/back split was a good decision, and then a planned change is to change the team breakdown.
  - Sounds like there is no reason to switch the team but then a planned change is to adjust the team?
  - Also mentions "we *made* this change" but this section is to discuss future changes.
- Goals that were not completed offer no explanation as to why.
- Highlights look good but do not really connect with the rest of the discussion above.
